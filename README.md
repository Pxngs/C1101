# JAMES

make DogeMiner.

heres a few tutorials.

making folders? name the folder and put a "/" and then type the name of the file you want to put in the folder. if the folder on gitlab only shows things you have to download? then just put in a random file and then delete it when your done with making it. 

deleting files/folders? just press the three dots and scroll down since its hidden.

uploading files: if you have to download the file from gitlab, then download the file, and then right next to the URL if youre on safari, then find the file on the download icon and drag the file into the "upload file" box.

for the code? just add a file and paste the code into the file.

email me if your haveing any issues with folders or files. i would like to see dogeminer 1 and maybe 2 in the ripped games folder by the end of today. im working on getting timmy on this.

lastly, what IM working on when i get home, is trying to start hosting the files from github with CDN. goodluck!
